## Test Results Structure

Each test returns detailed results including:
- **Test name** and description
- **Status** (passed/warning/failed)
- **Execution time** in milliseconds
- **Category** (UI/DATA/INTEGRATION)
- **Detailed results** with specific findings
- **Error information** when applicable

## Usage Instructions

### Running Tests Programmatically:
```javascript
// Access the navigation tester
const navigationTester = window.NavigationTester;

// Run all navigation and data consistency tests
const results = await navigationTester.testCrossScreenNavigation();

// Get test summary
const summary = navigationTester.getSummary();
```

### Using Test Runners:
1. **Full Test Runner**: Open `frontend/test-navigation-integration.html`
2. **Simple Test Runner**: Open `frontend/test-navigation-simple.html`
3. **Integrated Testing**: Use `SeiMoneyTesting.runFullTestSuite()`

### Integration with Comprehensive Tester:
The navigation tests are automatically included when running the comprehensive test suite:
```javascript
const results = await SeiMoneyTesting.runFullTestSuite();
```
