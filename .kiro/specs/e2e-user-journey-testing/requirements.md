# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a comprehensive end-to-end user journey testing system for the SeiMoney DeFi platform. The system will validate that all components (frontend, backend, SDK, and smart contracts) work together seamlessly by simulating real user interactions across all major platform features including payments, groups, pots, and vaults. The testing system will ensure data flows correctly between components and that the dashboard accurately reflects all user activities in real-time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform tester, I want to create and manage payment transfers through the UI, so that I can verify the payments system works end-to-end with real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Payments page THEN the system SHALL display a transfer creation form
2. WHEN a user fills the transfer form with recipient, amount, remark, and expiry date THEN the system SHALL validate all input fields
3. WHEN a user clicks "Create Transfer" with valid data THEN the system SHALL create the transfer and display it in "My Transfers" list
4. WHEN multiple transfers are created THEN the system SHALL display all transfers with correct status and details
5. WHEN a transfer is created THEN the system SHALL update the backend database and reflect changes in real-time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform tester, I want to create and manage groups through the UI, so that I can verify the group pooling functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Groups page THEN the system SHALL display a group creation interface
2. WHEN a user clicks "Create Group" THEN the system SHALL display a form with name, description, target amount, and type fields
3. WHEN a user submits valid group data THEN the system SHALL create the group and make it visible in the Groups list
4. WHEN multiple groups are created THEN the system SHALL display all groups with correct details and contribution capabilities
5. WHEN a group is created THEN the system SHALL enable users to make contributions to the group

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform tester, I want to create and manage savings pots through the UI, so that I can verify the savings functionality integrates properly with the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Pots page THEN the system SHALL display pot creation and management interface
2. WHEN a user creates a pot with name, target amount, target date, and description THEN the system SHALL save the pot configuration
3. WHEN a user makes an initial deposit to a pot THEN the system SHALL update the pot balance and progress bar
4. WHEN multiple pots are created THEN the system SHALL display all pots with correct balances and progress indicators
5. WHEN pot activities occur THEN the system SHALL reflect changes in real-time across all relevant UI components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform tester, I want to create and manage AI yield vaults through the UI, so that I can verify the vault system works with real blockchain data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Vaults page THEN the system SHALL display vault creation and management interface
2. WHEN a user creates a vault with strategy, initial deposit, and lock period THEN the system SHALL configure the vault properly
3. WHEN vaults are created THEN the system SHALL display TVL, APR, and user position information
4. WHEN multiple vaults are created with different configurations THEN the system SHALL handle all vault types correctly
5. WHEN vault operations occur THEN the system SHALL update all related metrics and display accurate yield information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform tester, I want the dashboard to accurately reflect all user activities in real-time, so that I can verify complete system integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current portfolio totals and activity summaries
2. WHEN a user clicks the refresh button THEN the system SHALL update all dashboard metrics with latest data
3. WHEN transfers, groups, pots, or vaults are created THEN the dashboard SHALL reflect these changes in portfolio totals
4. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display accurate counts for transfers, active groups, pots, and vaults
5. WHEN activities occur across the platform THEN the charts and KPIs SHALL update with real numbers from the backend

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform tester, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities, so that I can identify and resolve integration issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wallet connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL display clear connection status in the navbar
2. WHEN backend services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for debugging
3. WHEN data doesn't appear as expected THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information in browser console
4. WHEN system restart is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear restart procedures and log monitoring
5. WHEN integration failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable debugging steps and error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform demonstrator, I want a complete end-to-end testing workflow, so that I can prove the platform is production-ready during demos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the testing workflow is executed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate live data flow across all components
2. WHEN all test steps are completed THEN the dashboard SHALL show populated data proving integration works
3. WHEN the demo is conducted THEN the system SHALL show real numbers flowing between frontend, backend, and contracts
4. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide evidence that SeiMoney is a fully functional DeFi platform
5. WHEN integration testing runs THEN the system SHALL validate that all major platform features work together seamlessly
