# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the comprehensive fixing of all syntax errors, parsing errors, and linting issues in the frontend codebase. The project currently has 322 problems (318 errors, 4 warnings) that prevent proper compilation and development workflow. This feature will systematically identify and fix all these issues to restore the codebase to a working state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all syntax and parsing errors fixed, so that the codebase can compile successfully without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL return zero syntax errors
2. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL return zero parsing errors
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation is attempted THEN the system SHALL complete without fatal errors
4. WHEN JSX elements are used THEN they SHALL have proper opening and closing tags
5. WHEN expressions are written THEN they SHALL follow proper TypeScript/JavaScript syntax

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused variables and imports removed, so that the code is clean and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN variables are declared THEN they SHALL be used or removed if unnecessary
2. WHEN imports are added THEN they SHALL be used in the code or removed
3. WHEN error variables are caught THEN they SHALL either be used or properly prefixed with underscore
4. WHEN the linter runs THEN it SHALL not report unused variable warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase, so that type safety is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `any` type is used THEN it SHALL be replaced with specific types where possible
2. WHEN function parameters are defined THEN they SHALL have explicit types
3. WHEN interfaces are used THEN they SHALL be properly defined and imported
4. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN it SHALL not report type-related errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React hooks to follow proper dependency rules, so that the application behaves predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect hooks are used THEN they SHALL include all necessary dependencies
2. WHEN React hooks are implemented THEN they SHALL follow the rules of hooks
3. WHEN the linter checks React hooks THEN it SHALL not report dependency warnings
4. WHEN components re-render THEN they SHALL behave predictably due to correct dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all file imports and exports to be properly structured, so that the module system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files import modules THEN the imports SHALL be valid and accessible
2. WHEN files export components or functions THEN the exports SHALL be properly declared
3. WHEN the bundler processes files THEN it SHALL not encounter import/export errors
4. WHEN fast refresh is used THEN it SHALL work correctly with proper component exports
