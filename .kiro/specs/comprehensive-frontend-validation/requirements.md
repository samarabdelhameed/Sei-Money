# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive validation system for all frontend screens in the SeiMoney application. The system will systematically test each screen to ensure proper functionality, real data integration, and seamless integration with contracts, backend, agents, and bots. The validation will produce professional documentation similar to the existing CREATE_REAL_DATA_GUIDE.md format.

2. WHEN each screen is tested THEN the system SHALL verify real data is being displayed correctly
3. WHEN integration is tested THEN the system SHALL confirm connectivity with backend, contracts, agents, and bots
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive professional report

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify data flow between frontend and backend, so that I can ensure all API integrations are working properly.

2. WHEN real data is requested THEN the system SHALL confirm actual data (not mock/zero values) is returned
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL properly handle and report integration issues
4. WHEN data updates happen THEN the system SHALL verify real-time synchronization works correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate contract integration on each screen, so that I can ensure blockchain operations are functioning correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contract operations are initiated THEN the system SHALL verify successful blockchain transactions
2. WHEN wallet connections are made THEN the system SHALL confirm proper wallet integration
3. WHEN contract data is displayed THEN the system SHALL verify accuracy against blockchain state
4. WHEN contract errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling and reporting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test agent and bot integrations, so that I can ensure automated systems are working with the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent operations are triggered THEN the system SHALL verify agent responses and actions
2. WHEN bot integrations are active THEN the system SHALL confirm bot functionality with frontend
3. WHEN automated processes run THEN the system SHALL verify they update frontend data correctly
4. WHEN agent/bot errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle and report issues appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate professional validation reports, so that I can document the system's operational status comprehensively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate reports in Arabic following the established format
2. WHEN reports are created THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step instructions for each screen
3. WHEN issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance and solutions
4. WHEN success is achieved THEN the system SHALL document expected results and confirmation steps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate specific screen functionalities, so that I can ensure each part of the application works as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria
