# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for fixing critical connection issues in the SeiMoney frontend application. The system is currently experiencing API health check failures with malformed URLs and MetaMask connection errors that prevent users from connecting their wallets and accessing the application functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Health Check System Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to properly check backend connectivity, so that I can see accurate connection status and the app can function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL perform health checks with correctly formatted URLs
2. WHEN health check is performed THEN the system SHALL use the correct API endpoint format (not malformed URLs)
3. WHEN backend is available THEN the system SHALL display "Connected" status
4. WHEN backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN health check fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
6. WHEN multiple health check attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality

### Requirement 2: API URL Configuration Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API URLs to be properly configured and validated, so that all API requests use correct endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API client is initialized THEN the system SHALL validate base URL configuration
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL use properly formatted URLs without duplication
3. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate API endpoint configurations
4. IF API URL is malformed THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages and use fallback URLs
5. WHEN API client makes requests THEN the system SHALL construct URLs correctly without path duplication

### Requirement 3: MetaMask Connection System Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my MetaMask wallet successfully, so that I can access my account and perform transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user clicks "Connect Wallet" THEN the system SHALL check if MetaMask is installed
2. WHEN MetaMask is not installed THEN the system SHALL display installation instructions with download link
3. WHEN MetaMask is installed THEN the system SHALL initiate connection request
4. WHEN MetaMask connection is requested THEN the system SHALL handle user rejection gracefully
5. WHEN MetaMask connection succeeds THEN the system SHALL store connection state properly
6. WHEN MetaMask connection fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and guidance when connection issues occur, so that I can understand and resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API connection fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN MetaMask is not found THEN the system SHALL show installation guide with direct links
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest specific troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically retry failed operations
5. WHEN errors persist THEN the system SHALL provide alternative access methods or contact information

### Requirement 5: Connection Status Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time connection status, so that I know when the application is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application loads THEN the system SHALL display current connection status for all services
2. WHEN backend connection changes THEN the system SHALL update status indicators immediately
3. WHEN wallet connection changes THEN the system SHALL update wallet status indicators
4. WHEN connections are healthy THEN the system SHALL show green status indicators
5. WHEN connections have issues THEN the system SHALL show warning or error indicators with details

### Requirement 6: Fallback and Recovery Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work even when some connections fail, so that I can still access available functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL enable offline mode with cached data
2. WHEN MetaMask is unavailable THEN the system SHALL offer alternative wallet options
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL use cached data when available
4. WHEN connections are restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync with live data
5. WHEN in fallback mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate limited functionality to users
